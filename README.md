# timer
A timer with count-up and count-down capabilities, built with Qt C++ for the backend and QML for the frontend/UI.

Motivation:
To create something that was easier to use than default Timer found on Windows 10. I personally use the app to manage how long I spend on tasks.

Special Features:
- Increment/Decrement the time using the up and down arrow keys.
- An alarm to remind you that you are out of time.
